"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 112","","I realized that when you only focus on the light and positive thinking . . . then it's like you're staring up at the sun without looking down to notice that you were standing in a pile of feces. Something smells bad, but as long as you stare at the light then all the bad will go away. And instead of cleaning up the poo you spray perfume (affirmations) all over it. Meanwhile, shadow work is looking down at the shit so you can clean it up or even compost it into a lush garden."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 168","","“She Who Destroys the Light.” Similar to the Hindu goddess Kali, Persephone was worshipped as the Goddess of Death. So long before there was Pluto, there was Persephone, alone. Persephone was a maiden goddess in the sense that she was undivided, complete, whole-unto-herself. She was called Kore, which means “maiden” but also “core, heart.” She was understood to be the core, the heart, the essence of everything."

It occurred to me that I had been unconsciously enjoying and magnetizing self-devaluation for years, but I had never before let myself know it because it's a shameful, freaky, weird thing to be turned on by devaluation and scarcity in real life."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 324","","Existential Kink has such transformative power because it deals with the integration of the conscious and the unconscious minds, in a cutting-edge, rapid way."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 326","","Carl Jung (who was building on the insights of his mentor, Sigmund Freud) discovered, our conscious minds and identities (that is, the people we usually imagine ourselves to be) are just the very tippy tiny top of the immense underwater icebergs of our actual psychic totalities."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 329","","The basic formula for profound alchemical change is solve et coagula, which means: to first utterly dissolve (solve) an existing form and then to carefully bring the dissolved and purified elements together again (coagula) in a whole new, more potent and finely organized, permutation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 332","","The English word psyche, meaning “soul” or “mind,” comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning butterfly."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 332","","The English word psyche, meaning “soul” or “mind,” comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning butterfly."
"Highlight (Blue)","Location 336","","Visualizing, praying, affirming, spell-casting, making vision board collages, creating sigils, charging crystals, doing loving-kindness meditation . . . all of these are well-known, time-tested, and effective means of coagulating (“manifesting” as it were) a new reality into existence."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 338","","The only hitch is that the brighter we turn up the lights, the darker the shadows become."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 338","","The only hitch is that the brighter we turn up the lights, the darker the shadows become."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 341","","So if one has not done solve processes on the underlying unconscious shadow patterns, desires, qualities, and beliefs that created sucky situations in your life to begin with—then all the visualizing and affirming in the world can only bring you shells of outwardly changed circumstances, sans genuinely satisfying fulfillment."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 348","","You see, when a person does not know how to become conscious of their own vast unconscious (and most people haven't the faintest idea of how to do this), they tend to be controlled by it, meaning their lives are dominated and limited by stubborn and painful patterns kept in motion by their disowned unconscious desires . . . which is something that no amount of visualizing or affirming can fix."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 351","","As Jung emphasized: “Until you make the unconscious, conscious, it will rule your life and you will call it Fate.” But Jung also pointed out: “One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 358","","It's tricky: After all, these deep shadowy desires and curiosities of yours are unknown and unconscious (meaning: you are not knowingly aware of them, so they do not seem like they are yours at all!)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 360","","When this happens, because these taboo desires of yours have been disowned and repressed, you won't recognize their fulfillments as fulfillments. Instead these fulfillments of your deepest desires will often seem to your conscious mind like awful calamities. Thus it tends to seem like some agency outside of you—some call it cruel Fate—is making bad stuff happen to poor lil' ole you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 368","","Alex consciously desires what he's been told he “should” want: that is to be independent and autonomous and have a cool career."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 375","","The ironic thing is: as long as Alex resists allowing himself to consciously experience his job loss and his being “taken care of” by his parents as a great victory and fulfillment (in other words, as long as he resists consenting to experience it as kinkily awesome the very same way his unconscious experiences it), then the more he will feel out-of-control and cursed by Fate."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 378","","As long as Alex refuses to consciously enjoy his circumstance, he'll be inclined to see himself as a loser and a failure, he'll lose confidence, and he'll stay stuck. Paradoxically, the moment Alex becomes willing to “get on the side” of his taboo unconscious desire for dependence and goes ahead and deeply savors its victory—at that moment he can feel empowered again."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 382","","Then, rather than being a loser, Alex is actually a massively fulfilled person. From this vantage point of deciding to consciously allow himself to enjoy and be satisfied by his previously unconscious pleasure, it's then much easier for him to go ahead and make his way in the world. In essence, he's no longer guilty; he's not beating himself up anymore. He's no longer resisting his situation, so it doesn't need to persist."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 385","","This young man's enjoyment of his “failure” and “dependence” and state of “being taken care of” might seem perverse, weird. And indeed, of course, it is."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 390","","See if you can recognize any of these patterns from your own life or from the lives of your friends and family members:"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 393","","Hearing the mean voice of your third-grade teacher in your head whenever you sit down to create, so you avoid creating Overeating (or overindulging in drugs, alcohol, etc.) to cover up feelings of guilt, shame, loneliness, frustration that seem endless"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 398","","Having grand plans for the future, but never getting around to taking the first concrete steps to realizing those plans"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 399","","Being very sensitive and taking everything personally"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 400","","Habitually seeking approval, doing things to get people to like you even when you don't really want to do those things"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 405","","The majority of folks aren't even willing to acknowledge that they're in the grips of a pattern and therefore are not truly in control of their own lives—indeed, such an idea is very threatening to the ordinary ego."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 407","","If you doubt this, just think of how many people you know who are stuck in relationships or careers or mindsets that aren't working. From the outside, you can see that if only they took a few simple steps they could change their whole world, but they don't take those steps—they won't take those steps. Why? They're being ruled by their unconscious, and the foul scenes that they themselves are creating and perpetuating just seem to them to be their unwelcome Fate."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 418","","This method of integration works within days, weeks, and months rather than within years and decades. Why? Because Existential Kink doesn't just identify your shadow self. Existential Kink teaches you to embrace and love your shadow self."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 422","","Our day-to-day waking experience is also a kind of dream—more dense and more slow-moving than our nighttime dreams, yes, but still a dream nonetheless. When we know how to consciously, deliberately work with the contents of the unconscious, we gain an amazing degree of control over our waking lives—just as a lucid dreamer gains remarkable control over their night-time dreams by first becoming conscious that they are asleep and dreaming."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 429","","Through consciously enjoying and giving approval to these previously unconscious “guilty pleasures,” we interrupt and end the stuck patterns so that we can get what we really want in our lives."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 431","","Throughout all schools of tantric gnosticism (Hindu, Buddhist, and in the Western Esoteric tradition), there's an emphasis on learning how to stay present in high sensation. By “high sensation” I mean both intense physical feelings like pain and pleasure—and also intense emotional feelings, like anger, fear, and lust."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 435","","The fundamental tantric idea is that it's important to work with the strong energies of attraction and aversion, pleasure and pain, to facilitate awakening, rather than avoiding them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 438","","Likewise, in Existential Kink we focus on delving into taboo territories of our unconscious minds and learn to stay present with the high sensation there, in a way that transmutes the previously-stuck energy into free awareness."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 449","","if the ancient wisdom of Vedas are correct and the whole universe is just God playing elaborate rounds of hide'n'seek with Godself, then God is a super-freak."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 454","","I propose that all our suffering and stuckness in life comes from forgetting that we're divine sparks playing a wild kinky game and that great miracles can come forth in our lives when we reverse the process of forgetting by deliberately reclaiming the pleasure of the game—not just in our minds, but in our hearts and genitals."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 456","","I acknowledge this might be difficult to accept, especially after two thousand years of Christianity insisting on a God that's wholly “good” (who, nonetheless, is constantly, mysteriously counterbalanced by a powerful evil Devil)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 462","","When we do this, we become lucid in the dream of waking life, capable of executing marvels. We become undeniably, tangibly aware of the divine presence, the spark of Godself within us. We start to perceive our lives from the perspective of the divine curiosity within us, instead of from our grasping egos."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 468","","Consider this: our conscious selves (the selves who we usually take ourselves to be) definitely do not want all the “bad stuff” of life. In other words, our conscious selves (otherwise known as “egos”) believe that instead of failure, humiliation, poverty, illness, rejection, and sadness, we would much rather have wins, success, wealth, health, romance, joy, and so forth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 471","","In other words, it seems that in life we often end up getting the opposite of what we say we want. And, as Hollywood celebrities well know, it's possible to “have everything”—all the good stuff of the world, and still be totally, pathetically, wildly miserable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 475","","We are microcosmic reflections of the total holy macrocosm, and as such, we are each innately curious about and desirous for the full spectrum of potential experience, both the painful and the pleasurable, the evil and the good, the ugly and the beautiful."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 480","","And if you're curious as to what you unconsciously want, you don't need thirty years of psychoanalysis to figure it out: you can just take a look at what you currently have in your life and know that that's exactly what your unconscious wants, because what your unconscious wants, it gets."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 482","","As long as we insist that we absolutely don't want dark, freaky, unpleasant things, a major part of our full-spectrum human curiosity gets cut off, repressed, denied, and made unconscious. And this is bad news bears, because desire-curiosities in the unconscious have much, much more power to become manifest in material reality than our conscious, “good,” ego-approved desires do."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 485","","We need to learn how to own up to the darker side of our human curiosity and take such deep, shameless responsibility for it, and admit that we are willing to enjoy its challenging manifestations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 490","","Now don't get too alarmed when I tell you this, but the process of the Great Work is identical to the process of enlightenment (also known as individuation, awakening, initiation, or “becoming whole”). In short, it's the process of coming to viscerally identify less as a sorry, isolated individual and more and more as a wave in the ocean of God."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 498","","The first major stage of the Great Work was known to alchemists as the unio mentalis, the creation of a unified mind. It's important to note that “mind” in this alchemical sense does not just mean the ordinary thinking mind: it means unity within your own being, your thoughts, your emotion, and your will. We might say it's more like a “unified mentality” or “unified attitude.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 502","","The unio mentalis is a being that is not in conflict with itself; it's undivided and thus is extremely powerful."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 518","","This first unio mentalis stage of the Great Work that we're concerned with here involves healing the disconnect between our ideals, intentions, and inspirations (our spirit, the “masculine” or “projective” part of our being) and our embodied, emotional, sexual, creative energy (our soul, the “feminine” or “receptive” part of us, which is also the part of us that gets fertilized and “gives birth” to synchronous experiences in the outer world)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 524","","Consider this: on a soul-spirit level we're each grand cosmic hermaphrodites, endlessly self-fertilizing. Our spirit and our soul are both elements of the larger divine Self that we are. The higher Self that we are is unconscious in most human beings and so, as we've mentioned, it speaks mostly in dreams and through the manifestation of events (i.e. “synchronicities”)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 527","","When you begin to experience communications from the total Self not solely through dreams and synchronicities but as direct “knowing” within your own waking awareness, that's called the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel in the Western Esoteric tradition, which is also known as relating consciously to your inner Other (Anima/Animus), a process which Jung referred to as “the masterwork of individuation.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 532","","Think about it: if the Self contains everything, then the way to experience yourself as separate is to identify yourself with only one side of a polarity and to disdain the other side, to pretend it's “soooooooo not you.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 536","","personality that we take ourselves to be harshly judges, disowns, and denies huuuuuuge parts of our actual being, thus rendering them “unconscious” and creating the personal and collective shadow."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 538","","The Self includes all archetypes, all gods and daimons. Integrating the “naughty stuff” in what we call the shadow is just one part of relating to the previously unconscious Self, which includes the whole of our unconscious divinity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 543","","In other words, the emotions and desires and positions that our ego disowns inevitably haunt us (personally and collectively) by generating painful synchronous experiences that urge us to confront and reintegrate the disdained side of a polarity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 551","","To change the locus of your agency means to stop aligning yourself with your ego's one-sided choices (the ego tends to want only what it labels “the good stuff”) and to instead align yourself with the kinkier, more adventurous choices of the underlying total divine presence that we all are: the strange, vast Self which enjoys and is very curious about absolutely everything."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 554","","To do this, we have to greatly humble our ego's denial and fictional (if we were feeling feisty we might even say delusional) sorting of all experience into “good” (what appears to benefit me) and “bad” (what appears to not benefit me)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 559","","It's as if all of us humans are light bulbs, and the Self is the electricity that powers us. In becoming more identified with this underlying whole that we share with everyone, we paradoxically become more uniquely individual because we become free of our attachment to conventional, socially prescribed roles."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 561","","In waking up out of our absorbing fiction of separation, we link up the gigantic sexual, taboo, electrical energy (the shakti, the turn-on) in our bodies with our most inspired ideals and intentions. Then our ideals and our intentions gain the high-voltage electric “oomph” that they've been previously missing."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 565","","The Basque word for witch, sorginak, means “one who makes her own fate.” What I'm presenting to you here is a way to make your own fate: a witchy, tricksy, feminine path to enlightenment that's quite a bit different than the more publicly vaunted, masculine routes of asceticism, contemplation, and yogic saintliness."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 573","","To cast a spell is to communicate with your personal unconscious and the collective unconscious in a way that generates specific results through synchronicity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 574","","Believe it or not, you are casting spells at every single moment. Your words, your actions, the looks you give yourself in the mirror and the looks you give to other people. Your clothes. Your perfume. Your songs. Your smiles. Your laughter. Your reactivity and resentment. All spells."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 577","","You constantly perform who you believe yourself to be, as well as projecting the social identity and conditioning that you have imbibed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 578","","And since your performance of your identity entails a perpetual communication with your unconscious and the collective unconscious, you perpetually generate circumstances, relationships, and synchronicities that mirror and affirm and elaborate your identification."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 580","","If you want to know who you unconsciously believe you are, just take a look at your life, your surroundings, your relationship. Your life mirrors those deep beliefs."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 583","","Many of us have unconsciously accepted conditioned identities as “wrong” or “broken” or “deserving of resentment” or “not deserving to be highly valued”—and so we continue to magically generate results that reflect and affirm that."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 585","","I can't emphasize enough that this does not mean you are to “blame” for difficult circumstances and relationships that your unconscious creates. You, as an individual, are not “to blame” or culpable for karmic or social conditioning created beyond your individual, conscious choice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 587","","You are, however, as an individual, the only person capable of altering your unconscious conditioning and identity, and restoring it to its divine reality. You are capable; you are not “at fault” or “to blame.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 591","","The concept is this: You are not who you think you are. Whoever you happen to think you are, I assure you, you are not that. I suggest that you remind yourself of this often, because it makes this work easier. When you brush your teeth in the morning, think to yourself, “I'm not at all who I imagine myself to be. I'm something entirely different and far more vast and strange. Hmmmm. I wonder what I really am?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 595","","Who you think you are is largely a societally constructed fiction held together by some compulsively repetitive thoughts and stories, and it bears little or no resemblance to the being that you actually are."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 596","","Mr. Lon Milo Duquette says: “Magic is indeed all in your head, but your head is a hell of a lot bigger than you think it is.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 601","","The spirit is the active, projective part of the Self that perceives perfection, and it broadcasts inspirations based on its perception of endless possibility and perfection."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 602","","Our ego-personality, our conscious mind, often mistranslates these inspirations into a lot of opinions about how things “should” be, which maintains our sense of alienation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 608","","Remember, the spirit sees no limits, only pure simultaneous infinity and possibility. And when the conscious ego mind picks up on impressions from the spirit, it struggles to translate those into this limited material world, so those impressions of infinity end up sounding like ideas about how things “should be.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 610","","And the spirit-as-translated-by-the-ego, with all its infinity and opinions, tends to be quite judgmental of the animal self, with all its messy excretions and sexual desires and messy kitchens and appetites for cheesecake."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 614","","You see, the super-power of the spirit is total approval, total embrace, total celebration, the total perception of the already-existing perfection of life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 615","","When the spirit exclaims “perfect!” the conscious mind/the ego tends to hear that as “make things more perfect! They suck now!”—but actually what the spirit is saying is “everything is perfect right now!”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 617","","Yes, everything. The world and our selves in all their fucked-up glory. That experience of total approval and total embrace, total absence of shame or aversion, is what the spirit is always trying to teach us about and it's ironically what our conscious mind mistranslates as all those “shoulds” and judgments."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 621","","Existential Kink is a potent form of magic (also known as: “psychological integration”) in which the receptive feminine—the unconscious, the disowned and denied, the soul—becomes pregnant with the perfection-vision of our spirit—the masculine, projective part of our being, and eventually gives birth to positive synchronous manifestations in our lives."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 624","","This is actually the esoteric meaning of the Immaculate Conception. The Virgin Mary becomes pregnant with the total approval spirit energy of God—she lets its energy flow all the way down through her, to her instinctual animal self and genitals. When she does that, she conceives and later gives birth to Jesus Christ, who is a symbol of the Anima Mundi, the World Soul, aka the Self."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 628","","What that means is you're going to take all the embracing-approval-seeking-inherent-perfection-perceiving power of your spirit, tell your ego “thanks but you can shut the fuck up for a while,” and send all that embracing-approval-seeking-inherent-perfection-perceiving down to your actual life, body, emotions, and present situation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 635","","shame. And in dropping your resistance and negative judgment, you bring yourself fully into resonance with practical reality, which happens to be the only position from which you can effectively influence it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 639","","When you fully commit to incarnation here, in this material plane, fully commit to being who-you-already-are-and-having-the-experience-you're-already-having with total orgasmic kinky joy—there's a paradox right there. The paradox is that once you fully commit to being who you already are, having what you already have, and hugely celebrating it, you become a masterful practical magician, a force of nature capable of shifting circumstances very easily."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 650","","You see, the unconscious, creative, animal part of us is always getting impregnated with seeds from the spirit and is always giving birth to magical results. But usually those seeds from the spirit have been genetically modified by the ego,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 656","","To use dualistic language, we might say that before we get very deliberate about this work, we often create “negative” synchronicities. In other words, synchronicities or “meaningful coincidences” are perpetually happening: there's always a perfect, poetic rhyming mirror relationship between who you most deeply know yourself to be and what you externally experience."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 662","","The practice of Existential Kink that I'm about to share with you is a rapid and effective means of turning around who you most deeply experience yourself to be, thereby greatly improving the quality of synchronous experience in your life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 673","","In other words, the seven axioms I'll present are working propositions that I can't “prove” to you are true, but I can say that if you experiment with accepting them as true and see what consequences result from that acceptance, you will find those results to be fascinating and rewarding."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 677","","But, again, it's not the conscious part of us that “wants” difficulties or negative patterns. It's the unconscious part of us. The daemonic part. The part of us that we don't usually identify with, but that nevertheless strongly impacts our experience."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 681","","Jung explained throughout his work that your unconscious is the fertile, receptive, magically efficacious part of you. The unconscious is generative because the emotions, symbols, and attitudes within it create the synchronicities, or meaningful coincidences, that shape your experience."
